FiSH for weechat
================

This is a python plugin for weechat.  It implements blowfish encryption and
DH1080 key exchange and should be compatible with FiSH from
http://fish.secure.la/

Getting long lines cut off by the irc server? Try setting
irc.*.split_msg_max_length to something smaller:
    /set irc.server_default.split_msg_max_length 400

You can have an indicator showing whether messages in a buffer are encrypted by
adding the fish item to a bar:
    /eval /set weechat.bar.status.items ${weechat.bar.status.items},fish

If you want to keep the keys stored on disk to be encrypted you can use weechat
secure data:
    /secure set fish.foo cbc:verysecr1tkey
    /blowkey set #foo ${sec.data.fish.foo}
