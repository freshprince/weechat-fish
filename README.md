FiSH for weechat
================

*UPDATE* 
Now has option to encrypt keys in config file instead of storing in plain text.
Use:
```
/blowkey setpw
/blowkey unsetpw
```


This is a python plugin for weechat.  It implements blowfish encryption and
DH1080 key exchange and should be compatible with FiSH from
